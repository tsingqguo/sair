# SAIR
We propose the semantic-aware implicit representation by learning semantic-aware implicit representation (SAIR), that is, we make the implicit representation of each pixel rely on both its appearance and semantic information (e.g., which object does the pixel belong to). This work is publised in ECCV 2024.
